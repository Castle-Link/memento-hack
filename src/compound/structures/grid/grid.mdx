# Grid

Grid and GridItem implement the top-level layout structures used at the page level.
Note that Grids are not designed to be nested.

## Columns

This grid slices up the screen into a set of vertical 'columns', with fixed
gutters in between. You can wrap your components in the `<GridItem>` component,
specifying how many columns you want it to take up (i.e. span) horizontally.

If you specify a set of `<GridItem>`s whose spans add up to more than the total
number of columns, the grid items will wrap to the next row. The grid may also
wrap if you use too many gutters at the small breakpoint since the gutters are
30px, e.g. `11*30=330` which is larger than the smallest phone we support
(`320px`).

At this time, all breakpoints use a 12-column grid.

## Breakpoints

You can specify the column span independently for each breakpoint:

## Example usage

```jsx
<Grid>
	<GridItem sm={v} md={x} lg={y} xl={z}>
		{' '}
		...{' '}
	</GridItem>
	<GridItem ssm={v} md={x} lg={y} xl={z}>
		{' '}
		...{' '}
	</GridItem>
</Grid>
```

- `<Grid sm={4}>`: Spans 4 columns in all breakpoints
- `<Grid sm={4} md={6}`>: Spans 4 cols in the small breakpoint and 6 in the
  medium, large and xlarge breakpoints.
- `<Grid sm={4} md={6} lg={5}`>: Spans 4 cols in the small breakpoint, 6 in the
  medium breakpoint, 5 in the large breakpoint and xlarge breakpoints.
