# Modal

The Modal presents a modal, with a faded background around the modal.

The modal takes in:

- any React element as its body
- a `show` prop (whether to actually display the modal or not)
- a `onClose` prop that will be called when the user clicks the `Close` icon OR
  the background (since they would expect the modal to then close).

## useModal

In most cases, you should use the modal in conjunction with the `useModal` hook,
as such:

```
const Page = () => {
  const { showModal, onModalClose, onModalToggle } = useModal();
  return (
    <>
      <Button onClick={onModalToggle}>
        Open Modal
      </Button>

      <Modal show={showModal} onClose={onModalClose}>
        <div>Something amazing I guess</div>
      </Modal>
    </>
  );
};
```
